# LitterBox
![single grumpy cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20030454-55b8-4473-b7b7-f65bb7150d51)

Your malware's favorite sandbox - where red teamers come to bury their payloads.

A sandbox environment designed specifically for malware development and payload testing. 

This Web Application enables red teamers to validate evasion techniques, assess detection signatures, and test implant behavior before deployment in the field. 

Think of it as your personal LitterBox for perfecting your tradecraft without leaving traces on production detection systems.

The platform provides automated analysis through an intuitive web interface, monitoring process behavior and generating comprehensive runtime analysis reports. 

This ensures your payloads work as intended before execution in target environments.

## Features

### Initial Analysis
- File identification with multiple hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA256)
- Shannon entropy calculation for encryption detection
- Advanced file type detection and MIME analysis
- Original filename preservation

### PE File Analysis
For Windows executables (.exe, .dll, .sys):
- PE file type detection (PE32/PE32+)
- Machine architecture identification
- Compilation timestamp analysis
- Subsystem classification
- Entry point detection
- Section enumeration and analysis
- Import DLL dependency mapping

### Office Document Analysis
For Microsoft Office files (.docx, .xlsx, .doc, .xls, .xlsm, .docm):

## API Reference

### File Operations
```http
POST   /upload                          	  # Upload files for analysis
GET    /analyze/static/<hash>           	  # Static file analysis
POST   /analyze/dynamic/<hash>          	  # Dynamic file analysis
POST   /analyze/dynamic/<pid>           	  # Process analysis
GET    /files                           	  # Get list of processed files
GET    /resoults/<hash>/info                # Get file info
GET    /resoults/<hash>/static              # Get results for file static analysis
GET    /resoults/<hash>/dynamic             # Get results for file dynamic analysis
GET    /resoults/<pid>/dynamic              # Get results for pid analysis
```

### System Management
```http
GET  /health                 # System health and tool status check
POST /cleanup                # Clean analysis artifacts and uploads
DELETE /file/<hash>          # Delete single analysis
POST /validate/<pid>         # Validate process accessibility
```
